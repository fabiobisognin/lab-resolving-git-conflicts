FABIO BISOGNIN

# Who am I

* Where are you from?
Born and raised in Vicenza (it's a small city in the north-east of Italy beween Verona and Venice)

* What do you do?
At the moment I am business developement manager at grupo Odem (Scappino). I am in charge of the custom made shirt programme for the mexican market (STUDIO SCAPPINO) and corporate relations for the US private label programme for Frank & Eileen and GRAYSON brands. 

* Do you have previous experience with technology/data?
Not really. I never considered myself tech-friendly but I eventually started to deal with data for my job. 

# Why am I here

* What has brought you to Ironhack?
I realized I need to learn data analysis: I consider myself very analytical but I cannot use this skill for everything I want as I don't know how to code. I am sure this skills can give me what I miss to work at another level. I am planning to make a big carreer change.

* What knowledge/skills do you expect to learn in this bootcamp?
I want to learn coding and get a good knowledge of how to process data. I am also very interested in AI systems so I want to get solid basis to keep studying.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* Which industry will you seek employment in?
I recently realized that fashion retail industry has not a big future. I haven't decided yet. However, I am following up the law process for the cannabis legalization as I'd like to work in that industry: possibly by applying technology for cannabis retailing.

* What will your future role look like?
I'd like to keep working as business development manager or product owner with a focus on data. My ideal role is very flexible in terms of working hours and holidays, I prefer to work and get paid on the projects I develope or simply on results!

* What is your career goal?
I don't know if I am ready yet but I'd like to build my own business before I turn into 40 years old.
